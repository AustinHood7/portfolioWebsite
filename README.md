# portfolioWebsite
This is a portfolio website I am creating without any frameworks, only HTML and CSS. I plan on adding features such as parallax scrolling and embedded youtube videos for each projct that I have completed. I strayed away from frameworks so I can gain proper knowlege on what can be done using just HTML and CSS and explore the frameworks available later. Sass was used to add some additional functionality to CSS and enhance the overall look of the site. This is a Work In Progress so it has not yet been posted, there is a PDF to get a small view on what this site looks like.
